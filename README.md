Protein Solvation in Allosteric Regulation: A Water Effect on Hemoglobin by Marcio F. Colombo and others:
- ~60 extra water molecules bind to hemoglobin when transitioning from fully deoxygenated tense (T) state to the fully oxygenated relaxed (R) state.
- 50 - 70 water molecules

Valid molecular dynamics simulations of human hemoglobin require a surprisingly large box size
- Changes of the salt bridge to Lys40 (discussed by Perutz)
- distance between the two Calpha atoms of His146 of the two Beta chains to distinguish R/T state
- Dist between two Calpha of His143 to monitor width of opening
- RMSD between Calphas
